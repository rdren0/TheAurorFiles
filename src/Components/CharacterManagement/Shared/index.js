almost, some weird duplicated text. also isnt working if the level one selection is the innate heritage


Diagnosed rendering issues and component logic for character creation.

Looking at your screenshot, I can see two issues:

Duplicated "Standard Feats" header text - there's duplicate text being rendered
Level 1 choice logic not working properly when Innate Heritage is selected
Let me help you fix both issues:

Now I need to create/update the StandardFeat component to handle the level 1 choice properly and avoid duplicate headers:


StandardFeat.js
Code 




import { standardFeats } from "../data"; import { createFeatStyles } from "../../styles/masterStyles"; import { useTheme } from "../../contexts/ThemeContext"; import { allSkills } from "../CharacterSheet/utils"; export const StandardFeat = ({ character, setCharacter, setExpandedFeats,

Diagnosed duplicate headers and level 1 choice rendering logic.

Looking at your code, I can see the issue! You have a duplicate header because both the parent wrapper and the StandardFeat component are rendering headers. Let me fix this:

Now I need to update your StandardFeat component to include the proper help text since we removed the wrapper. Let me update that:

Let me also add the default export to the StandardFeat component:

Perfect! I've fixed both issues:

Issues Fixed:
Duplicate "Standard Feats" header: Removed the wrapper div that was creating a duplicate header. Now the StandardFeat component handles its own header.
Level 1 choice logic: The conditional rendering should now work correctly for both Innate Heritage and Standard Feats.
Key Changes Made:
Removed the duplicate wrapper div around StandardFeat that was causing the header duplication
Updated StandardFeat component to include proper help text based on character level
Added characterLevel prop to ensure the component has the correct context
Simplified the conditional rendering to directly call the components without extra wrappers
How it works now:
When "Innate Heritage" is selected: Only the InnateHeritage component shows
When "Starting Standard Feat" is selected: Only the StandardFeat component shows with its own header and help text
No duplicate headers since each component manages its own title
Proper feat limits based on character level and level 1 choice
The logic should now work correctly whether you select Innate Heritage or Standard Feats at level 1, and the duplicate header issue is resolved!




so upon further reflection I think that character creation and character editing should be 2 totally different things and components. The Tab should be Character mangement and it should have sub tabs of Create New and My Characters. That way we can control when a user is allowed to add things, and we can also handle th eui for leveling up

You're absolutely right! That's a much better architecture. Having character creation and character editing as separate components with different rules and UIs makes way more sense. Let me refactor this into a proper Character Management system with subtabs.
