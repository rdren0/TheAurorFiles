Feathers, Fumbles, and Foot-in-Mouth Disease

The second official week began without ceremony.
Each Monday before reporting to the Owlery, Draco was required to meet with his probation advisor to discuss the performance report Graham submitted at the end of every week. It was never a long meeting—just long enough to be uncomfortable. They didn’t ask much. They didn’t have to. The parchment said enough.
This morning was no different.
The worker barely glanced up from his desk when Draco entered.
 "Performance: Troll," he said, flipping a page with the enthusiasm of a man reviewing compost.
"Still in compliance," he added, almost as an afterthought.
Draco signed the parchment they slid across the desk.
There were no further comments.
No questions.
No goodbye.
He left the office without a word.





Draco arrived on time. Not early—he hadn’t fallen that far—but close enough to see Graham already inside, halfway through inventory and not remotely surprised to find Draco standing in the doorway.
There was no greeting.
“South end’s due for a full scrub,” Graham said, nodding toward a quadrant of filth that had somehow evolved over the weekend. “Don’t step on the floor panels near the water line—they’re still unstable from the… incident.”
He didn’t elaborate. Draco didn’t ask.
He pulled on the gloves, picked up the mop, and got to work.
The owls seemed marginally less aggressive. One actually let him clean the perch beneath it without lunging. He muttered something about “progress” under his breath.
Graham didn’t comment.
The Performance: Troll notice was still pinned to the wall near the supply shelf. It had curled slightly at the corners but remained perfectly legible—typewritten, centered, smug.
Draco still glared at it.

By mid-morning, the silence had become routine. Not companionable, exactly. Just tolerable.
A screech owl swooped low—far too low—and both men ducked instinctively at the same moment, colliding slightly at the shoulders before straightening again. Graham had just looked up from his clipboard in time to avoid losing it to talons.
The bird disappeared into the rafters, triumphant.
Draco muttered, brushing feathers from his hair. “That one hates me.”
“I call it Lord Beakface.” said Graham.
 A pause. “It hates everyone.”
Draco made a sound that might have been the start of a laugh. Graham didn’t follow up. The moment passed like most things did in the owlery: quickly, and with the sound of distant flapping.

Later, while resetting perch brackets near the back wall, Draco was up to his elbows in rusted bolts and avian detritus when he asked, idly:
“So, what were you—Ravenclaw?”
Graham didn’t even blink.
“Didn’t have a house. I’m a Squib.”
 Then, without pause: “Went to a Muggle boarding school. Full of twits, but the uniforms were sharp.”
Draco hesitated. He hadn’t expected that. The tone had been too casual, too practiced. Clearly rehearsed. Clearly meant to leave no room for sympathy.
He scrambled to fill the space, said the first thing that wasn’t silence.
“Really? But you’re so—”
 He caught himself too late.
 “...civilised.”
The pause that followed wasn’t long. It didn’t have to be.
“Thanks,” Graham said coolly, and returned to sorting feed trays like they hadn’t spoken at all.
Draco didn’t speak again until lunch.
When he did, it was about feed schedules.




They met at the café Theo liked—technically a teashop, but it served alcohol after five, which meant Theo liked to pretend it was cultured. It had white tablecloths, overpriced biscuits, and absolutely no one from the old crowd.
Draco arrived late, still smelling faintly of owlery and damp indignity.
Theo had already ordered. He didn’t greet Draco, just slid a scone across the table like it was a hostage exchange. Draco stared at it like it might bite him.
“Well?” he asked, pouring tea like a man who hadn’t earned it. “Still covered in bird crap and shame?”
Draco sat heavily. “I said something stupid.”
Theo didn’t look up. “Yes, but I’ve asked about this week.”
Draco hesitated. Then: “The owlery supervisor. He’s a Squib.”
Theo raised both eyebrows. Slowly. “Oh. Bold placement. How’s that going?”
Draco looked away. “I asked if he was Ravenclaw. He said no. I said—” He winced. “I said he seemed... civilised.”
Theo made a small choking noise into his teacup. “Oh no.”
“I didn’t mean it like that.”
"Of course you didn’t. You just meant, ‘Wow, you’re remarkably clean and articulate for someone who has to knock two rocks together to make fire.’" He grinned. “Brilliant save, really.”
Draco groaned and put his head in his hands.
Theo leaned back. “So what’d he do? Tell you off? Sic an owl on you?”
“He just said ‘Thanks.’ And kept working.”
“Oh,” Theo said with delight. “That’s so much worse. Now you don’t know if he’s mad or just cataloguing your failures for later deployment.”
Draco muttered, “I hate you.”
“You should. I’m a walking cautionary tale.”
They paused as the server refilled their tea.
When she left, Theo said, more seriously, “Look. He probably gets that kind of thing all the time. You might not be the first, just the most… dramatic.”
Draco didn’t answer.
Theo sipped. “Anyway, if you want to fix it, maybe try not being such a knob.”
Draco raised a brow. “That’s your advice?”
Theo nodded. “That, and don’t call him civilised again. Unless it’s sarcastic. In which case, lean in.”
Draco stared at him. “You are deeply unhelpful.”
Theo smiled. “And yet, I’m all you’ve got these days.”
